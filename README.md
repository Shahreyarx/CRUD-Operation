# CRUD

**CRUD** stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** — the four basic operations you can perform on data in a storage system. ==
---

## Description

- **Create** — add a new record or resource  
- **Read** — retrieve or view existing data  
- **Update** — modify or change existing data  
- **Delete** — remove data  

These operations are foundational in web applications, APIs, and databases, mapping often to HTTP methods: POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE.
